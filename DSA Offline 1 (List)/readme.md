This directory contains total 5 source files
-Arr.cpp
    This file contains the array based implementation of list ADT. It contains a constructor, a destructor, 11 public functions (as per the assignment table-1) and a function to print the list in instructed way. However, several private functions are used for the sake of implementation.
-LL.cpp
    This file contains the linked list based implementation of list ADT. It contains a constructor, a destructor, 11 public functions (as per the assignment table-1) and a function to print the list in instructed way. However, several private functions are used for the sake of implementation.
-Task_1.cpp
    This file contains a main function using the above mentioned list ADT implementation function. It checks the implementation of the functions mentioned in table-1 of instruction manual.
-Task_2.cpp
    This file contains a main function using the above mentioned list ADT implementation function. It checks the implementation of the functions mentioned in table-2 of instruction manual.
-Task_3.cpp
    This file contains a main function and couple of other functions which demonstrates the CRS system using the funtions from table-1.

**NOTE: - The method of implementation can be changed by only changing the class_name in #define segment
        - The init function takes two argument - one is the initial size of the list and the other is the memory chunck size, for linked list implementation the later value is ignored.
