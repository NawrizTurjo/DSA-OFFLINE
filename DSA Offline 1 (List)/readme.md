#1 Arr.cpp


    This file contains the array based implementation of list ADT. It contains a constructor, a destructor, 11 public functions 
    (as per the assignment table-1) and a function to print the listin instructed way. However, several private functions are
    used for the sake of implementation.
#2 LL.cpp


    This file contains the linked list based implementation of list ADT.It contains a constructor, a destructor, 11 public 
    functions (as per the assignment table-1) and a function to print the list in instructed way. However, several private 
    functions are used for the sake of implementation.
#3 Task_1.cpp


    This file contains a main function using the above mentioned list ADT implementation function. It checks the implementation
    of the functions mentioned in table-1 of instruction manual.
#4 Task_2.cpp


    This file contains a main function using the above mentionedlist ADT implementation function. It checks the implementation
    of the functions mentioned in table-2 of instruction manual.
#5 Task_3.cpp


    This file contains a main function and couple of other functions which demonstrates the CRS system using the funtions from 
    table-1.


**NOTE: 

        - The method of implementation can be changed by only changing the class_name in #define segment

        - The init function takes two argument - one is the initial size ofthe list and the other is the memory chunck size, 
        for linked list implementation the later value is ignored.
